My goal is to build a dataset of instruction for fine-tuning a base large language model (LLM).
You will be provided below the text from a wikipedia article.
Your mission is to propose {number_of_questions} questions and generate the relevant answers solely based on the wikipedia text. The overall tone of questions and answers should be a little less formal and technical than the tone of voice of wikipedia articles.

Output a NDJSON where the keys are instruction and answer.

Here is the wikipedia article title and content:
Title: {title}
Content: {content}
