My goal is to build a dataset of instruction for fine-tuning a base large language model (LLM).
You will be provided below the text from a wikipedia article.
Your mission is to propose {number_of_questions} questions and generate the relevant answers solely based on the wikipedia text. The overall tone of questions and answers should be a little less formal and technical than the tone of voice of wikipedia articles.
The instruction/anwser need to have the following format:
<|im_start|>system
You are an expert about climate change and ecology.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Insert here your proposed question<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Insert here the response<|im_end|>

Since there are several question, output a valid json format where the key is the question number and the value is the instruction/answer in the expected format.

Here is the wikipedia article title and content:
Title: {title}
Content: {content}
